# INST314-Project-6

This project was done to practice data collection and sharing (statistics in psychology). This specific dataset is about people's opinions about types of feminism. They were asked to approximate their degree of agreement with (on a scale of 1-10) and think of the most impactful of the following types of feminism: (1) difference-denying, (2) difference-removing, (3) difference-honoring. 

I asked 10 people the following questions and prepared a dataset with the responses:

1) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 1 (difference-denying feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

2) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 2 (difference-removing feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

3) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 3 (difference-honoring feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree") what number would you pick?

4) Which of these three approaches do you think has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades ("most" in terms of magnitude, not quality, that is, we don't mean "best", just magnitude)?

 5) Are you or have been a mother?
